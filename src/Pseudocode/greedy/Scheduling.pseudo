Greedy-Scheduling(activities):
    Sort activities by their finishing times in non-decreasing order
    selectedActivities = []
    endTime = -infinity

    for each activity in activities:
        if activity.startTime >= endTime:
            selectedActivities.append(activity)
            endTime = activity.endTime

    return selectedActivities


    Given n events with their starting and ending times, find a
    schedule that includes as many events as possible.
