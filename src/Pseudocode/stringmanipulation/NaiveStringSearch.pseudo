NaiveStringSearch(haystack, needle):
    n = length of haystack
    m = length of needle

    for i from 0 to n - m:
        j = 0
        while j < m and haystack[i + j] == needle[j]:
            j = j + 1
        if j == m:
            return i
    return -1


Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
