function hammingWeight(n):
    count = 0
    while n != 0:
        count = count + (n & 1)  // Add the least significant bit of n to count
        n = n >> 1  // Shift n to the right by 1 bit
    return count

Write a function that takes the binary representation of a positive integer and returns the number of
set bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
