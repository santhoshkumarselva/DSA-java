function maxSubArraySum(Arr):
    maxSum = Arr[0]
    currentSum = Arr[0]

    for i from 1 to length of Arr - 1:
        currentSum = max(Arr[i], currentSum + Arr[i])
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum)

    return maxSum

Given an array Arr[] of N integers.
Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.

Time complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(1)
