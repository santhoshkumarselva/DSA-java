function hasPathSum(root, targetSum):
    if root is null:
        return false
    if root.left is null and root.right is null:
        return root.val == targetSum
    return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val) OR hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum,
return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that
adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.
A leaf is a node with no children.
